# Risk Factors for Osteoporotic Fracture Case Study

Osteoporosis affects a significant number of people in the United States, with an estimated 54 million
individuals affected. Fractures resulting from this condition are common, with up to one in two women and
one in four men over 50 experiencing an osteoporosis-related fracture. This condition weakens bones and
increases the risk of fractures in areas such as the spine, hip, wrist, and shoulder. The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data on risk factors such as age, gender, race, BMI,
smoking, and alcohol use to identify underlying health conditions that contribute to osteoporotic fractures.
This information is used to develop strategies for prevention and management. This case study uses data from
the 2007-2008 NHANES survey, which included 10,149 individuals, to examine risk factors for osteoporotic
fractures.
